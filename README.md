# Memory Game

## Description
Memory Game App is an app that lets users flip cards to find matching pairs. When two matching cards are found, they disappear; if they don't match, they flip back over. Users can reset the game with a button and choose the number of card pairs to play with.

## Features
### Required Features
- App loads to display a grid of cards initially placed face-down.
- Users can tap cards to toggle their display between the back and the face.
- When two matching cards are found, they both disappear from view.
- Users can reset the game and start a new game via a button.

### Optional Features
- Users can select the number of pairs to play with (at least 2 unique values like 2 and 4).
- App allows users to scroll to see pairs out of view.
- Enhanced visual appeal with colored buttons, backgrounds, or unique card designs.

### Additional Features
- Set the background to dark mode using SwiftUIâ€™s `.preferredColorScheme(.dark)`.
- Created an App Icon.

## Notes
One challenge I encountered while building the app was implementing the card-flipping logic to ensure that unmatched cards flipped back over smoothly after being revealed.
